Thanks for the note. Can you forward this to your employer or the person that handles billing in your office? Would love to be connected with them to see if Better makes sense.
Sounds great. I'll set a placeholder meeting -- as we approach the date we can adjust the time/date as needed.
Great! I'm connecting you with my colleague, Phil, so you two can set up a good time to chat. Phil - would you mind following up here to share more info on the course? Thanks!
Regarding budgeting, CreatorUp budgets based on a package of content created- in order to best build your digital brand voice, it takes more than a one-and-done video, but a series of content to share across the web. In general, to create a sequence of 12 shorter videos (30-45 seconds) for roughly ~$15K-$20K, or 1 long video (2 minutes) and 3-4 short videos for that same price. These prices fluctuate based on if content is already filmed, where we are filming, and what you're looking for.
Thanks for the note. May I ask what tools/solutions you use to manage top-of-the-funnel outreach and retargeting across email/phone/LinkedIn for sales and marketing? Is this something that you folks find is hard to manage or easy to have leads fall through the cracks?
Sounds great. Would you mind forwarding my message to the coworking space administrators? We'd love to see if we can help them with these services. Thanks!
In case you weren't aware, coaching by phone can be coded as a telehealth service and we have experience in filing these types of superbills. Please don't hesitate to let us know if we can help your patients that you coach via phone with retrieval of reimbursement for this service too.
Thanks for the update; I've taken note of it. Do you know of any colleagues you had who would find Rev helpful to their work? I'd love to see if we could help them. 
Thanks for the update. I'll be sure to remove you from our contact list. Have a wonderful day.
Thanks for doing so! Cheers
